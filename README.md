## Portfolio website

Portfolio website built to display the projects developed through my coding journey.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

Runs the app with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), the next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. We address the key pain points developers and QA engineers face when testing modern applications.
